We couldn&#39;t get another story mode😭😭😭
BRO WHY CAN&#39;T IT JUST BE ANIMATED!!!!!!!!
KSI no longer feels like a failure
So basically Jack Black doesn’t belong in the trash can so take him out
STEP RIGHT THIS WAY!<br>🟥👍
If Steve is Jack Black, Alex must be Jill White.
God no
sadly i think this movie is enchated with curse of binding
IM STEAVEEE <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE2YZhcC4NY&amp;t=44">0:44</a>
I like the (step right this way!) thing
Who agrees that it would be better if we waited for the animated version of Minecraft?
I Am STEVE. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE2YZhcC4NY&amp;t=44">0:44</a>

This trailer for the Minecraft movie it gives me a Theory how they got into the Minecraft world
They definitely asked ChatGPT “Make up a Minecraft movie idea”
Shouldve been animated but im excited either way
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE2YZhcC4NY&amp;t=78">1:18</a> THE BEST PART
&quot;Anything you can dream about here, you can make.&quot;<br><br>Me: &quot;Can we please make a better movie?&quot;
Это отвратительно. Я перебрал все неофициальные фильмы и анимаиции, я не нашёл той, которая хуже этого.
Damn can&#39;t wait ❤😂🎉
People are just ruining video games by this. Like next they gonna be making a roblox and fortnite
TECHNOBLADE NEVER DIES
They really need to animate the real movie.
we still have time to fix the minecraft movie! everyone start talking trash until they recast change it or animate it

What the hecck Is this same trash
Because Steve forced him
That ain&#39;t Minecraft, that&#39;s Mincaft 💀
Change characters to animated characters ❤❤❤🎉😅😂😅😂😂😊

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE2YZhcC4NY&amp;t=40">0:40</a> the fire is the zombies fireing
We need a sonic treatment for this
honestly, the trailer doesnt look too bad unless you’re talking about the llama, people, and well, the steve line.
Wow, they took 10 years and 1.5 million dollars to release a disappointment
This is cheeks
This movie would be better if we just got rid of all of it
Wither storm pls😔

yall better get a sonic movie ahh save with this one or we&#39;ll have a problem😭🙏
Minecraft is my favorite game
Why do the animals look creepy- <br>😭
It can still be good
Imagine how real life villager will look like
It sounds interesting
Remember that the original Sonic was so bad that paramount do all the movie again, maybe Warner do the same for this movie

This actually looks terrible, we saw a trailer at the cinema today and my son and I won&#39;t be watching this, it could have been so good like the Mario movie but this looks pure trash.
Warner Bros in Minecraft in the Movie I love it

The uncanny valley effect has come.
this deserves the world record for most dislikes
these are my tears: 😢<br>💧💧💧💧💧💧💧<br>💧💧💧💧💧💧💧<br>💧💧💧💧💧💧💧<br>🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊
Я люблю Майнкрафт, но я отказываюсь смотреть ТАКОЙ фильм. Мне было бы интересно увидеть, как бы выглядел мир Майнкрафт в реальной жизни, вместе со всеми этими безумными теориями, которые придумывают простые игроки и заставляют мой мозг взрываться от восторга. Но вместо этого мы получаем фильм, который превращает нашего любимого, крутого главного героя – Стива (с которым мы буквально прошли через горы и моря, огонь и воду, ад и край мира, с которым мы победили великого и ужасного легендарного дракона края) в... простого неудачника. 😢
OMG it looks real😮
说真的，不如不做，就是说那史蒂夫啥时候变那样了😂
So stupid it’s Hilarious!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE2YZhcC4NY&amp;t=39">0:39</a> if you look closely behind all the piglins you can see a shifted enderman
My minecraft dog is dead after watching this teaser 😂😂😂🤬🤬🤬😡😡 what is this
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE2YZhcC4NY&amp;t=36">0:36</a> &quot;He&#39;s...right behind me, isnt he....&quot; ahh seen
Everyone thought Transformers One was gonna be bad and we were proven wrong. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s gonna be the same case with this film. 😔
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE2YZhcC4NY&amp;t=44">0:44</a> greatest introduction ever🗣️🗣️🗣️
&quot;Anything you can dream about here you can make&quot;<br><br>Can I make this not exist?
Cap cut ahh movie 💀💀💀
I passed by the Minecraft era and have never played the game. I know a little bit about diamonds, and creepers, and the ender world or whatever, but my knowledge on the game is barren. So as someone who does not care about Minecraft at all, I must say I feel personally offended for all the hardcore fans who were hoping this movie was going to be good. I am sorry.
we got the minecraft movie trailer before GTA 6
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE2YZhcC4NY&amp;t=44">0:44</a> I am steve
I am steve<br>👇🏻
The only thing good of this is the beatles song on the background
Literally the llamas face
Remixing any Beatles song is blasphemous and honestly makes this 10x worse than it already is. Thanks I hate it
The like/dislike ratio has to many digits to count
wtf
NO NO NO! Dont do this. Pls
I&#39;m gonna be honest....I wont watch it ever
I am Steve 🔥🔥🔥🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE2YZhcC4NY&amp;t=47">0:47</a>
This is garbage.
Why did the guy who made the movie like this!
Can&#39;t wait to review this one!
Like REAL LIFE
Boo
