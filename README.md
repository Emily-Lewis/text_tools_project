## Topic
**Sentiment analysis of comments on trailers posted on YouTube**

I have three main scripts for this project:

1. Python script using Google's YouTube API to extract 100 most recent comments per video in a text file.

2. Shell script to iterate over extracted text file and clean and tokenize it.

3. Python script for sentiment analysis of cleaned text files using nltk library.
